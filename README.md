# Cash Moneyz ðŸ’µ
Revolutionizing the way you budget your expenses, one transaction at a time.

## Description
Finding it hard to keep track of all your expenses between online and offline payment methods? Cash Moneyz can help you out. With the simplest and the most minimalistic UI imaginable, Cash Moneyz allows you to manage all your expenses from one screen. All your data â€” from transaction amount, type, and description â€” is automatically pushed to a Google Sheet where you can manipulate the data and sort as you please.

### Background
I built this app as a solution for my own spendthrift lifestyle, in the hopes that it makes me a more responsible spender in college. After using the app for a week, I found that I was able to cut back on more than a third of my total spendings.

### Visuals
(updating soon)

## Installation
For installation, clone this repository to your local device:
``` git clone https://github.com/psrth/cashmoneyz ```

Open a google sheet, and in the script editor, add the code attached in ``` gsheetScript.txt ```.

Once you publish as a web app, copy the URL and paste it in the ```controller.dart``` file, as ``` static const String URL = "PUT YOUR URL HERE";``` 

Once this is done, build the flutter file using:
``` flutter build apk```.

## Roadmap
I'm not a _huge_ fan of the UI right now, so a future update might include a revamp from the minimal black and white. Also, I might create a user database and have logins and editable sheet URLs in the app natively.

## Usage
Go wild with it. Email me with any feedback you might have.
